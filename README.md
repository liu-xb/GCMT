Codes of our IJCAI 2021 paper "Graph Consistency based Mean-Teaching for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Person Re-Identification. Xibin Liu, Shiliang Zhang. IJCAI 2021".

Run `python train.py` will train the unsupervised model on Market-1501 dataset. The unsupervised model trained on Market-1501 can be downloaded from [here](), which achieves % and % in mAP and Rank1 accuracy, respectively.
